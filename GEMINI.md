## Project Overview

A simple recipe finder application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to search for recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand.

**Current Status (2025-08-27):** The application is functional and uses the Spoonacular API to search for recipes.

## Current Features

*   **Ingredient Input:** Users can add ingredients one by one. Each ingredient is displayed as a tag and can be removed.
*   **Recipe Search:** Search for recipes using the Spoonacular API based on the list of ingredients.
*   **Recipe Display:** Displays a grid of recipe cards with images, titles, and links to the full recipe.
*   **Changelog:** A section on the main page that displays the history of changes made to the application.

## Changelog

This section documents the major updates and changes to the application.

*   **Changelog Feature Added:** A new component has been added to the UI to display a timeline of project updates for viewers.
*   **API Change: Switched to Spoonacular:** The recipe search is now powered by the Spoonacular API, providing access to a much larger database of recipes and more powerful search capabilities.
*   **New Ingredient Input:** The comma-separated textarea has been replaced with a more user-friendly system. You can now add ingredients one by one, and they appear as tags that can be easily removed.
*   **Receipt Scanning Feature Removed:** The experimental feature to scan ingredients from a receipt using OCR has been removed to focus on improving the core recipe search experience.
*   **Initial Recipe Search:** The app was first built using TheMealDB API and a simple textarea for entering a comma-separated list of ingredients.
*   **Initial Project Setup:** The project was initialized with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Next Steps

*   **Styling Enhancements:** Further refine the UI/UX with additional Tailwind CSS classes for a more polished look.
*   **Detailed Recipe View:** Consider adding a dedicated page or modal to display full recipe details when a recipe card is clicked.
*   **Error Handling:** Add more robust error handling for API calls and provide clearer user feedback for loading states and errors.

## Recent Updates (2025-08-27)

This section details the recent enhancements and fixes to the application, focusing on improving build stability, code quality, and image optimization.

*   **Build Process Stabilization:** Addressed and resolved critical build errors related to TypeScript's `no-explicit-any` rule. This involved:
    *   **Explicit Type Definitions:** Introduced specific interfaces (`TabscannerResult`, `LineItem`, `SearchResultRecipe`) to replace generic `any` types in API response handling and data mapping functions within `src/app/api/tabscanner/route.ts` and `src/app/page.tsx`. This significantly improves code readability, maintainability, and type safety.
    *   **ESLint Compliance:** Ensured the codebase now adheres to stricter ESLint rules, preventing the use of untyped `any` which can lead to runtime errors and make code harder to reason about.
*   **Image Optimization:** Replaced standard `<img>` tags with Next.js's optimized `<Image />` component in `src/app/page.tsx`. This change improves:
    *   **Performance:** Images are now automatically optimized, lazy-loaded, and served in modern formats, leading to faster page loads and better user experience.
    *   **Core Web Vitals:** Contributes positively to metrics like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).
*   **Git Hygiene:** Added `nextprompt.txt` to `.gitignore` to prevent temporary build log files from being committed to the repository, maintaining a cleaner version control history.
*   **Vercel Image Display Fix:** Resolved a 400 error encountered during Vercel deployment where images were not displaying. This was fixed by explicitly configuring the `img.spoonacular.com` domain in `next.config.ts` under `images.domains`. This ensures that Next.js's Image Optimization correctly handles images served from external sources in the Vercel environment.

These updates collectively enhance the application's robustness, performance, and adherence to modern web development best practices, making it a more stable and efficient foundation for future development and deployment, especially in a Vercel pipeline.
